# GitHub Pages Deployment with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to automatically deploy changes made to `index.html`
to **GitHub Pages** using a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Features
- Deploys to GitHub Pages when `index.html` is changed.
- Runs automatically on pushes to the `main` branch.
- Hosted at: `https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/`

## Stretch Goal
You can replace `index.html` with a static site generator like Hugo, Jekyll, or Astro for a full portfolio site.
